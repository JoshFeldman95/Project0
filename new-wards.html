                    <p>This is an op-ed Zac Smith and I wrote on the new wards in Toronto</p>

                    <h1 id="new-wards-new-problems-the-unintended-consequences-of-bill-5">New Wards, New Problems: The Unintended Consequences of Bill 5</h1>

                    <p>Torontonians voted on Monday under something of a cloud. Premier Doug Ford’s August decision to cut city council nearly in half without consultation or warning left many angry and confused. This sentiment appears to have had repercussion on election day; voter turnout, which had reached an all-time high in 2014, fell to 41% — a 19% drop. But Monday’s results aside, the transformation from 47 to 25 councillors also has real consequences for the long-term health of our political community.</p>

                    <p>For constituents, having our issues addressed depends on having a representative who has the time and incentive to pay attention. As representatives become responsible for more and more constituents, our vote loses value; our voice grows quieter within the affairs of our own city. From now on, your vote for city councillor counts 1.88 times less than it did before. In other words, you are trying to be heard in a crowd almost twice the size.</p>

                    <p>Closer examination of Toronto’s new wards also reveals less obvious consequences. Using 2016 Census data from the city’s ward profiles (available through Toronto’s Open Data Catalogue) we compared how different demographic groups were represented before and after Bill 5. The analysis demonstrated some sizeable shifts.</p>

                    <p>For example, under the old map 57% of city councillors represented wards where the majority of constituents were first-generation Canadians. With the new map, this proportion fell to 48%. By redrawing Toronto’s wards, the Ford government fundamentally shifted the balance of political power within the city and altered how the needs of first-generation immigrants are heard and addressed. New Canadians are more likely to require language and settlement services and are right to ask their city to provide them. But under the revamped ward system, the political incentive to meet these needs decreases dramatically.</p>

                    <p>Another salient example: certain visible minority groups lost more representation than others. Those who identify as Korean, South East Asian, or Latin American, on average, had their ward size expanded more than the typical Torontonian. Conversely, Torontonians who indicated they were South Asian, Chinese, or Filipino lost less representation compared to the average.  These demographics are by no means destiny when it comes to political decision-making. But insofar as people identify within these demographic groups, they are one way to understand how people bring their lived experience into the voting booth. By arbitrarily reordering the political balance of the city, the “Better” Local Government Act fundamentally reshaped how Toronto’s diversity is represented at City Hall.</p>

                    <p>These consequences were probably unintentional. In fact, it is unlikely the provincial government gave much thought to demographics at all when it hurriedly redrew Toronto’s wards. But these outcomes matter, particularly in the long term. In 2016, the Toronto Ward Boundary Review prepared a 70-page report which considered exactly what the city’s ward structure should look like. After consulting with Torontonians and comparing the various alternatives (including the 25-ward option adopted by the Ford government), the review found that the 47-ward model most effectively represented the people of Toronto.  As is too often the case in this political era, the Ford government opted to ignore public wishes and the thoughtful deliberation of experts. Whatever end they sought, their haste and carelessness in ramming the Better Local Government Act into being before the election not only limits the scope of our effective political representation, it also reshapes just who our representatives have to think about when making decisions.</p>

                    <p>The votes have been cast and the results are in. For this election at, at least, the lines have been drawn. But it doesn’t mean we should shrug off the consequences. Politicians have to be held to a higher standard when making the important decisions that determine how our communities are heard and our city is governed. Although the election is now on the books, we as Torontonians should demand effective representation for ourselves and our neighbours.</p>
