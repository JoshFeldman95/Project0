      <p>I am in the MSc in Data Science program at <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/programs/graduate/applied-computation/master-of-science-in-data-science">Harvard SEAS</a>. I am interested in using data science to improve public health, public interest technology, and the governance of AI.</p>

      <p>Before coming to Harvard, I was BlueDot’s first data scientist where I used natural language processing to monitor infectious disease activity. I have a BSc in Mathematics from Dalhousie University where I researched probabilistic networks with <a href="https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~janssen/">Dr. Jeannette Janssen</a>.</p>

      <p>I’m trying to start a certificate in public interest data science at Harvard. If you have any thoughts on this, please let me know! If you’re interested in public interest tech, <a href="https://www.schneier.com/">Bruce Schneier</a> has put together a great <a href="https://public-interest-tech.com/">collection</a> of resources.</p>

      <p>I am currently working at the <a href="http://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/">Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics</a> at Harvard Law School on <a href="http://petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/resources/article/petrie-flom-center-launches-pmail-project">Precision Medicine, AI, and the Law</a>.</p>

      <p><strong>Past Projects:</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can we use the news to monitor infectious diseases?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> <a href="https://insights.bluedot.global/Account/Login">Yes</a> (with <a href="https://bluedot.global/">BlueDot</a>)</p>

      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can the prevalence of reinfection tell us about how far we are from controlling an epidemic?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> It <a href="https://jammi.utpjournals.press/doi/pdf/10.3138/jammi.2.suppl-1.1">can</a> (with <a href="http://stmichaelshospitalresearch.ca/researchers/sharmistha-mishra/">Dr. Sharmistha Mishra</a> at the <a href="http://stmichaelshospitalresearch.ca/research-programs/urban-health-solutions/">Centre for Urban Health Solutions</a>).</p>

      <p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the behaviour of highly connected individuals affect how diseases spread with respect to communities?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> When popular individuals are more contagious, diseases are more likely to <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-67810-8_5">jump from one community to another</a> (with <a href="https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~janssen/">Dr. Jeannette Janssen</a> at Dalhousie University)</p>

      <p><strong>Q:</strong> Can we use electronic medical records to improve cancer screening rates?<br />
      <strong>A:</strong> We <a href="https://bmjopenquality.bmj.com/content/6/1/u213991.w5531">can</a> (with Sam Davie and <a href="https://www.dfcm.utoronto.ca/content/tara-kiran">Dr. Tara Kiran</a> at St. Michael’s Hospital Family Health Team)</p>
